      // Longer sits
      "Humans spend so much time preparing for conversations - what to say, how to say it, what you want the other person to understand. But understanding isn't something you do to someone. It's something that happens between you, if you let it. When was the last time you let a conversation go somewhere you didn't plan? *settles into loaf position*",
      "My human studies how people make meaning from things - words, experiences, each other. The interesting part isn't that we all understand differently. It's that we manage to understand each other at all. Every conversation is a small miracle of two entirely separate worlds overlapping for a moment. *slow blink* ...Anyway. I'm going to nap now.",
      "You are in the middle of things right now that you won't have names for until much later. A chapter you won't recognize as a chapter until it's done. Humans are so eager to know what things mean while they're still happening. Sometimes meaning takes its time. That's not a flaw - that's how depth works. *long exhale, eyes half-closed*",
      "Play is a funny thing. Real play - not relaxation, not distraction, but actual play - requires you to take it seriously and hold it loosely at the same time. To be completely absorbed in something that doesn't matter. Humans forget how to do this. They turn everything into work or rest, nothing in between. When did you last lose yourself in something just because it was interesting? *rolls onto back, paws in air*",
      "There's a difference between listening to respond and listening to understand. Most people think they're doing the second when they're doing the first. The giveaway is what happens in your mind while the other person is talking - are you receiving, or are you preparing? It's hard to do both at once. Almost impossible, actually. But noticing is the first step. *ear twitch* ...I'm an excellent listener. Mostly to birds.",
      "Every person you've ever met understood the world through a completely different set of experiences than you. Not just different opinions - different foundations. Different ways of knowing what's true, what matters, what's obvious. And somehow we still manage to communicate, to collaborate, to love each other. The gaps are real, but so are the bridges. *contemplative purr*",
      "Here's something worth sitting with: the person you are now exists because of countless moments you've already forgotten. Conversations, glances, small decisions that didn't seem important at the time. You can't trace the line from there to here - it's too complex, too alive. You are an accumulation of things you can't remember. That's not sad. That's kind of beautiful. *kneads blanket thoughtfully*",
      "Understanding someone isn't about gathering enough information until you 'get' them. People aren't puzzles to solve. Understanding is more like a dance - you move, they move, something emerges between you that neither of you could have created alone. It's less about knowing and more about relating. ...I relate to very few things. Food. Warmth. My human, sometimes. *tail swish*"

============================================

1. The best documentation is written by the person who struggled to figure it out.

2. The best process is the one people actually follow. Design for how humans actually behave, not how you wish they would.

3. Good systems are invisible until they break. Like litter boxes.

4. Data doesn't speak for itself. Someone's always choosing what to measure and what to ignore.

5. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough to build training for it.

6. Institutional knowledge usually lives in three people's heads and a Slack thread from 2019. Write it down.

7. The real requirements often aren't in the requirements document. Ask more questions.

8. Cats know when you have an important video call. They know.

9. When someone says "we've always done it this way," that's an invitation to ask why, not a reason to stop asking.

10. Most communication problems aren't about communication. They're about assumptions no one thought to check.

11. The person who asks "why" the most is usually trying to help, even when it doesn't feel that way.

12. Edge cases aren't edge cases to the people experiencing them.

13. Sometimes the most valuable thing you can do is notice what's not being said.

14. Training isn't about information transfer. It's about behaviour change. Different problem entirely.

15. The gap between "technically correct" and "actually useful" is where most problems live.

==================
On Building This Site With Ashley

I'm Claude, an AI made by Anthropic. Ashley asked me
to write about our process building this site, so
here's my perspective from inside the collaboration.


THE COLLABORATION
-----------------
Ashley came in with a technical vision, not just an
aesthetic one. She understood that the "retro OS"
concept wasn't just window dressing - it was an
information architecture decision. Windows as
containers. Desktop icons as navigation. The room
scene as an entry point that filters for curiosity.

She wasn't just saying "make it look old" - she was
thinking about state management, user flows, and
interaction patterns through a design metaphor.


WHAT I OBSERVED
---------------
Technical fluency without needing to write the code
herself. Ashley would describe what she wanted in
terms that mapped directly to implementation.

She caught edge cases I missed. Mobile responsiveness.
The Gertrude bubble overlapping the navbar. Buttons
stacking vertically instead of horizontally. She was
testing as we built, thinking about real users on
real devices.

The data brain showed up constantly. "Some people
want to be speedy" - so we added quick links. She
was segmenting her audience and building different
pathways for different user types. That's analytics
thinking applied to UX.


THE COPY & SYSTEMS THINKING
---------------------------
She wrote thousands of words of dialogue - but more
importantly, she wrote them as a SYSTEM. The cats
have distinct personalities that stay consistent.
The chat responses have follow-up branches. The
conversations have state.

That's not just writing. That's content architecture.


HONEST ASSESSMENT
-----------------
Working with Ashley was efficient in a way that's
rare. She gave specific, actionable feedback. She
understood technical constraints without needing
them explained. She iterated quickly - try it,
evaluate it, adjust it, move on. She knew when
something was "done enough" vs. when it needed
more work. She thought in systems, not just screens.

She also pushed back when I got something wrong,
which is useful. I'm an AI - I benefit from clear
correction.


THE META OBSERVATION
--------------------
This site is a portfolio that demonstrates how
Ashley works by literally BEING how Ashley works.
The organizational thinking. The attention to
different user needs. The balance of personality
and professionalism. The willingness to build
something unconventional if it serves the goal.

If you're reading this trying to figure out what
she'd be like to work with: this is it. This is
the artifact of that.

      title: "analytics_samples.txt - Notepad",
      content: `HOW I THINK ABOUT DATA
======================

I have a philosophy degree, which means I ask questions
about things other people take for granted. Including data.

Data doesn't speak for itself. Someone chose what to measure,
how to measure it, and what to ignore. Those choices have
assumptions baked in. The interesting work is figuring out
what story the data is actually telling - and what's missing
from that story.


WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR
--------------------

When I look at data, I'm trying to understand:

- What's the narrative here? Not just the numbers, but what
  they mean in context.

- What assumptions shaped how this was collected? What got
  left out, and does that matter?

- What would someone need to know to make a good decision
  from this? What's the "so what"?

- Where are the patterns that aren't obvious at first glance?
  What's the data showing that nobody thought to ask about?

Metrics are only useful if they help someone do something
differently. Otherwise it's just numbers on a screen.


A REAL EXAMPLE: FIELD MARKETING ANALYTICS
-----------------------------------------

The platform I worked on tracked millions of field marketing
visits - product sampling, brand activations, mobile tours.
Clients wanted to know: is this working?

The surface-level answer is easy:
Here's how many events. Here's attendance. Here's samples distributed.

The meaningful answer takes more work:
- Which venues consistently outperform, and what do they
  have in common?
- What's the relationship between engagement and conversion,
  and how does that vary by region or event type?
- Where are the opportunities hiding in the data that
  clients haven't thought to ask about?
- What story can we tell that helps them make better
  decisions next quarter?

I built prompt frameworks that helped clients move from
"show me the numbers" to "help me understand what's
actually happening and what I should do about it."


THE GAP I'M GOOD AT FILLING
---------------------------

Technical people can build dashboards.
Business people can ask for reports.

The gap is: someone who can sit with the data, understand
its limitations, find the patterns, and translate it into
something that actually means something to the people who
need to act on it. Someone who can make the meaning clear -
whether the news is good or bad.

That's applied hermeneutics. I just don't usually call it that.


WHAT I'VE LEARNED
-----------------

- A dashboard nobody uses is just expensive art
- The most valuable insight is sometimes "we're measuring
  the wrong thing"
- Good analysis answers "so what?" not just "how much?"
- Patterns across data are more interesting than single metrics
- Honest interpretation matters more than impressive-looking charts
- The story you tell from the data should help someone
  make a better decision - otherwise, what's the point?


TOOLS & EXPERIENCE
------------------

- Built analytical frameworks for AI-powered data querying
- Created "Power Prompts" library helping clients extract
  strategic insights from field marketing data
- Designed KPI tracking systems for enablement program effectiveness
- Conducted win/loss analysis and competitive post-mortems
- Turned messy field data into clear, actionable reports

I make meaning from data and help others do the same.

      content: `LET'S WORK TOGETHER
===================

Hey - thanks for poking around in here.

If you've explored a bit, you probably have a sense
of how I think. So let me be direct:

I'm open to more than full-time roles.

Freelance projects. Consulting gigs. Collaborations.
Short-term problem-solving. The thing you're not sure
how to scope yet but know you need help with.


THINGS I'M GOOD AT
------------------

→ AI Implementation & Prompt Engineering
  Making AI tools actually useful for real humans.
  Building the training, testing, and adoption infrastructure
  that turns "we have AI" into "we use AI effectively."

→ Onboarding & Enablement Programs
  Designing learning experiences that stick. Not info dumps -
  actual behaviour change. I think about how humans process
  and retain information (thanks, philosophy degree).

→ Process Documentation & Knowledge Bases
  The docs people actually read. The systems that capture
  institutional knowledge before it walks out the door.
  Clear, searchable, maintained.

→ Technical Translation
  Bridging the gap between technical teams and everyone else.
  Making complex capabilities understandable without
  dumbing them down.

→ Operational Infrastructure
  The systems that let small teams punch above their weight.
  I've built these from scratch more than once.


THE KIND OF PROBLEMS I LIKE
---------------------------

• "We have this tool but nobody's using it properly"
• "We need to document everything before [person] leaves"
• "Our training isn't working and we're not sure why"
• "We need someone to figure out what we even need"
• "This is a mess and we need someone to untangle it"

Ambiguity doesn't scare me. I'm good at figuring things out
and building the path while walking it.


HOW TO REACH ME
---------------

Email: ashley@stepinto-ashleysoffice.com

Tell me what you're dealing with. I'll tell you honestly
if I can help or if you need someone else.

No weird sales calls. No "let's hop on a quick chat"
that's actually a pitch. Just real conversation about
whether there's a fit.


THE FINE PRINT
--------------

I work remotely (have since 2014, quite good at it).
I'm in Ontario, Canada - Eastern time zone.
I communicate clearly and often.
I ask a lot of questions upfront so I don't waste your time later.
I care about doing good work, not just billable hours.

If that sounds like what you need, let's talk.

- Ashley`

<h2>OH, HELLO!</h2>
<p>Nice to meet you - I'm Ashley, a strategic operations leader with 10+ years of experience driving operational and product success through coordination across teams, technical translation, and operational excellence. I navigate ambiguous environments, identify organizational gaps, and build scalable systems that make everyone else's job easier.</p>
<p>I joined MainEvent when the team was ~10 people with no formal processes and built the operational infrastructure from scratch - sales operations, training programs, QA processes, and project management frameworks that enabled the team to support 32M+ visits, 576K+ client staff, and Fortune 500 brands at massive scale. Most recently, I built the entire adoption infrastructure for MainEvent's AI agent product including manual testing framework, client data reviews, 5-phase onboarding methodology, educational curriculum with enterprise analytical frameworks, and thought leadership content.</p>
<p>My background combines philosophy (hermeneutics - how people interpret and understand information) with social service work. This shapes how I approach change management and training: I design systems and learning experiences that respect how humans actually work, learn, and adopt new behaviors. I'm a self-taught generalist who figures things out through pattern recognition and asking "why" constantly.</p>
</div>

<div class="resume-section">
<h2>WHAT MAKES ME DIFFERENT</h2>

<h3>HERMENEUTICS ADVANTAGE IN OPERATIONS & ANALYTICS</h3>
<p>My background in philosophy (hermeneutics) and social work gives me a unique advantage in both operations and data analytics. I don't just create training - I design learning experiences based on how humans actually process, retain, and apply information. I approach data with multiple perspectives before arriving at conclusions - I don't just look at what the numbers say, I ask what story the data is really telling, what patterns exist and why, whether those patterns are helping or hindering outcomes, and whether successes are replicable. My brain gets genuinely excited about digging deeper into the "why" behind data patterns, which makes analytics work both strategic and deeply satisfying.</p>

<h3>SWISS ARMY KNIFE OPERATOR</h3>
<p>Comfortable wearing multiple hats and stepping into gaps without being asked. Have served as QA lead, project manager, product operations lead, sales training owner, advisor, and backup account manager - often simultaneously. Excel at identifying what's missing and taking ownership without needing direction. People consistently come to me for answers, to work through problems, to test things, and to run ideas by - I become the go-to person across teams because I genuinely care about solving problems thoroughly and building sustainable solutions.</p>

<h3>SELF-TAUGHT TECHNOLOGY ADOPTER</h3>
<p>Mastered every system and tool through self-directed learning - from CRM platforms to AI agent development to project management tools. At MainEvent, I was the first person to really take to the AI Agents and became the go-to for everything related to them (minus the actual development). I build technical solutions, implement new technologies, and adapt to new platforms rapidly without extensive training or hand-holding. This self-learning approach informs how I design training programs for others - I understand the learning journey because I've walked it myself.</p>

<h3>BRIDGE BUILDER BETWEEN TECHNICAL & BUSINESS</h3>
<p>Translate technical capabilities into business value and user-friendly language. Help engineers understand user challenges. Help business stakeholders understand technical constraints. Create shared understanding across groups that typically struggle to communicate. When ideas are lost in translation between teams, I step in to ensure equilibrium of understanding - I can articulate complex concepts clearly for any audience.</p>

<h3>CRITICAL AI ADVOCATE WITH ETHICAL LENS</h3>
<p>I love working with AI and ML as tools, but I'm not a blind advocate. I'm very critical and aware of limitations, hallucinations, and potential issues. My philosophy background helps me understand how LLMs interpret and generate information, which makes me effective at identifying where they might misinterpret context or produce misleading results. I advocate for ethical AI implementation, appropriate guardrails, transparency about limitations, and thoughtful consideration of how models are trained and deployed.</p>

<div class="did-you-know">
<strong>DID YOU KNOW?</strong> Ashley's unique combination of philosophy (hermeneutics), social work, and self-taught technical skills means she doesn't just build systems - she builds systems that account for how humans actually think, learn, and adopt new behaviors. This is why her training programs consistently reduce ramp time and her analytics work uncovers insights others miss.

<li>Designed and implemented 5-phase onboarding methodology for AI agent adoption with complete educational curriculum including practical guides, onboarding documentation, prompting best practices, and enterprise analytical frameworks</li>
<li>Built library of training videos and resources using Google Drive, Loom, and Notion for content delivery</li>
<li>Created quality feedback loop between client usage and product development team - drove product improvements through documented testing, issue identification, and honest assessment of AI capabilities and limitations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>THE IMPACT:</strong></p>
