      "Every conversation changes both people. Even this one. *slow blink*",
      "When did you last do something with no goal in mind? *languid stretch*",
      "Play isn't a break from real life. What if it's the realest part? *ear twitch*",
      "What would you try if you knew the outcome didn't matter? *curious tilt*",
      "A game is only a game if you let it absorb you completely. When were you last absorbed? *purr*",
      "What question would you ask if you weren't worried about the answer? *slow blink*",
      "What memory changed meaning as you got older? *thoughtful mrrp*",
      "Are you the same person you were ten years ago? How do you know? *whisker twitch*",
      "What are you in the middle of that you won't recognize until later? *tail swish*",
      "Sunbeams move across the floor all day. I follow them. What are you following? *warm purr*",
      "What would you do with an afternoon you didn't have to account for? *yawn*",
      "Words meant something different to the person who wrote them than they do to you now. Both are real. *blink*",
      "What's something you know deeply but struggle to explain? *mrrp*",
      "What have you stopped noticing because it's always there? *ear perk*",
      "There's a bird outside. Do you know what kind? I do. *intense stare*",
      "What would a child ask about your work that you couldn't easily answer? *head tilt*",
      "When did you last look at something long enough to really see it? *slow blink*",
      "What small thing made today different from yesterday? *curious mrrp*",
      "What's a question you've given up trying to answer? *soft purr*",
      "The most interesting people are comfortable saying 'I don't know.' Are you? *tail curl*",
      "I think about very little and I'm very happy. Related? Unclear. *nap incoming*",
      "The red dot teaches us about desire. And also cardio. *pant*",
      "My human made this whole website. I contributed by sitting on the keyboard. *proud*",
      "I have no resume. I have presence. *regal stare*",
      "Sometimes I knock things off tables just to see what happens. When did you last experiment? *innocent blink*",
      "I've been staring at the wall for ten minutes. It's called thinking... or maybe it's a ghost... *tail flick*",
      "What's something you'd love to learn if you had infinite time? *dreamy purr*",
      "What's the most interesting thing you've changed your mind about? *attentive gaze*",

      // Longer sits
      "Humans spend so much time preparing for conversations - what to say, how to say it, what you want the other person to understand. But understanding isn't something you do to someone. It's something that happens between you, if you let it. When was the last time you let a conversation go somewhere you didn't plan? *settles into loaf position*",
      "My human studies how people make meaning from things - words, experiences, each other. The interesting part isn't that we all understand differently. It's that we manage to understand each other at all. Every conversation is a small miracle of two entirely separate worlds overlapping for a moment. *slow blink* ...Anyway. I'm going to nap now.",
      "You are in the middle of things right now that you won't have names for until much later. A chapter you won't recognize as a chapter until it's done. Humans are so eager to know what things mean while they're still happening. Sometimes meaning takes its time. That's not a flaw - that's how depth works. *long exhale, eyes half-closed*",
      "Play is a funny thing. Real play - not relaxation, not distraction, but actual play - requires you to take it seriously and hold it loosely at the same time. To be completely absorbed in something that doesn't matter. Humans forget how to do this. They turn everything into work or rest, nothing in between. When did you last lose yourself in something just because it was interesting? *rolls onto back, paws in air*",
      "There's a difference between listening to respond and listening to understand. Most people think they're doing the second when they're doing the first. The giveaway is what happens in your mind while the other person is talking - are you receiving, or are you preparing? It's hard to do both at once. Almost impossible, actually. But noticing is the first step. *ear twitch* ...I'm an excellent listener. Mostly to birds.",
      "Every person you've ever met understood the world through a completely different set of experiences than you. Not just different opinions - different foundations. Different ways of knowing what's true, what matters, what's obvious. And somehow we still manage to communicate, to collaborate, to love each other. The gaps are real, but so are the bridges. *contemplative purr*",
      "Here's something worth sitting with: the person you are now exists because of countless moments you've already forgotten. Conversations, glances, small decisions that didn't seem important at the time. You can't trace the line from there to here - it's too complex, too alive. You are an accumulation of things you can't remember. That's not sad. That's kind of beautiful. *kneads blanket thoughtfully*",
      "Understanding someone isn't about gathering enough information until you 'get' them. People aren't puzzles to solve. Understanding is more like a dance - you move, they move, something emerges between you that neither of you could have created alone. It's less about knowing and more about relating. ...I relate to very few things. Food. Warmth. My human, sometimes. *tail swish*"

      content: `THINGS I'VE LEARNED (that nobody tells you)
============================================

1. The best documentation is written by the person who struggled to figure it out.

2. The best process is the one people actually follow. Design for how humans actually behave, not how you wish they would.

3. Good systems are invisible until they break. Like litter boxes.

4. Data doesn't speak for itself. Someone's always choosing what to measure and what to ignore.

5. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough to build training for it.

6. Institutional knowledge usually lives in three people's heads and a Slack thread from 2019. Write it down.

7. The real requirements often aren't in the requirements document. Ask more questions.

8. Cats know when you have an important video call. They know.

9. When someone says "we've always done it this way," that's an invitation to ask why, not a reason to stop asking.

10. Most communication problems aren't about communication. They're about assumptions no one thought to check.

11. The person who asks "why" the most is usually trying to help, even when it doesn't feel that way.

12. Edge cases aren't edge cases to the people experiencing them.

13. Sometimes the most valuable thing you can do is notice what's not being said.

14. Training isn't about information transfer. It's about behaviour change. Different problem entirely.

15. The gap between "technically correct" and "actually useful" is where most problems live.

      content: `ASHLEY'S ACTUAL TO-DO LIST
============================

[x] Build fun portfolio website (in hyper-focus mode for days)
[x] Add philosophical Gertrude
[x] Question whether this is too much
[x] Decide it's not too much
[x] Write resume
[ ] Resist urge to make resume a choose-your-own-adventure
[ ] Seriously resist that urge
[x] Add a different game instead
[x] Add cats
[x] Add MORE cats
[ ] Pet actual cats (overdue)
[ ] Sit down so Gherkin stops yelling at me

SOMEDAY/MAYBE:
- Learn to tolerate corporate jargon and norms
- Find a job where "why?" is encouraged not suspicious
- Sew my own clothes
- Write hermeneutics-based guide to interpreting Jira tickets
- Stop laughing so hard that I startle Gherkin off my lap
     - Kidding - I'll never stop cackling

DONE (celebrating small wins):
- Thrived in 10+ years of remote work
- Built things that worked
- Made it weird in a good way
- Bought neck warmer for sub-zero office temperature
- Met loads of colleagues turned friends - and isn't it all about the friends we meet along the way?
- Being perpetually curious`

<h2>OH, HELLO!</h2>
<p>Nice to meet you - I'm Ashley, a strategic operations leader with 10+ years of experience driving operational and product success through coordination across teams, technical translation, and operational excellence. I navigate ambiguous environments, identify organizational gaps, and build scalable systems that make everyone else's job easier.</p>
<p>I joined a field marketing SaaS company when the team was ~10 people with no formal processes and built the operational infrastructure from scratch - sales operations, training programs, QA processes, and project management frameworks that enabled the team to support 32M+ visits, 576K+ client staff, and major CPG brands at massive scale.</p>

<div class="resume-section">
<h2>WHAT MAKES ME DIFFERENT</h2>

<h3>HERMENEUTICS ADVANTAGE IN OPERATIONS & ANALYTICS</h3>
<p>My background in philosophy (hermeneutics) and social work gives me a unique advantage in both operations and data analytics. I don't just create training - I design learning experiences based on how humans actually process, retain, and apply information.</p>

<h3>SWISS ARMY KNIFE OPERATOR</h3>
<p>Comfortable wearing multiple hats and stepping into gaps without being asked. Have served as QA lead, project manager, product operations lead, sales training owner, advisor, and backup account manager - often simultaneously.</p>

<h3>SELF-TAUGHT TECHNOLOGY ADOPTER</h3>
<p>Mastered every system and tool through self-directed learning - from CRM platforms to AI agent development to project management tools. I build technical solutions, implement new technologies, and adapt to new platforms rapidly.</p>

<h3>BRIDGE BUILDER BETWEEN TECHNICAL & BUSINESS</h3>
<p>Translate technical capabilities into business value and user-friendly language. Create shared understanding across groups that typically struggle to communicate.</p>

<p><strong>Hey there!</strong></p>
<p>I'm Ashley - a human being who sees the gaps between teams and builds the systems to fill them. Self-taught generalist. Pattern recognizer. The connective tissue that keeps organizations from falling apart.</p>
<p>Philosophy background (hermeneutics - how people interpret information) + social work training = I design systems that respect how humans actually think, learn, and adopt new behaviors. Not how we wish they would. How they actually do.</p>
<p>The path here was winding: philosophy at Guelph, social work at George Brown, receptionist at an ad agency, finance in London, sales ops, then 7+ years at a startup that became about five different jobs. Every step taught me something I still use.</p>
<p>Based in Guelph, Ontario. Remote worker since 2014. Pink office walls. A wall unit I got for $80 twelve years ago that stores all my favourite things. Two cats named Gertrude and Gherkin who have very different personalities and very strong opinions.</p>

            content: `POWER PROMPTS FRAMEWORK
========================

PHILOSOPHY:
Good prompts aren't about tricking AI - they're about
providing enough context for accurate interpretation.
(Hermeneutics in action!)

STRUCTURE:
1. Context Setting
   "Given [time period] data for [scope]..."

2. Specific Request
   "...identify [metric] patterns where..."

3. Output Format
   "...present as [format] including [elements]"

4. Validation Cue
   "...and flag any data gaps or anomalies"

EXAMPLE POWER PROMPTS:

COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS:
"Compare our Q3 performance across all retail
locations against Q2, highlighting any stores
where visit completion dropped more than 10%.
Present as a table with location, both quarters'
rates, and the delta. Note any locations with
incomplete data."

TREND DETECTION:
"Identify the top 5 performing product categories
this month versus the same month last year. For
each category, show: total visits, completion rate,
average duration, and YoY change. Flag any
categories with sample size under 100 visits."

            description: "QA methodology for validating AI prompt reliability",
            content: `PROMPT TESTING FRAMEWORK
=========================

WHY TEST PROMPTS?
LLMs can confidently give wrong answers. Testing
isn't optional - it's the difference between
"AI-powered" and "AI-trusted."

TESTING METHODOLOGY:

1. BASELINE VALIDATION
   - Run prompt against known dataset
   - Compare output to manually calculated result
   - Document any discrepancies

2. EDGE CASE TESTING
   - Empty data sets
   - Single data point
   - Extremely large data sets
   - Data with nulls/gaps
   - Conflicting data

3. INTERPRETATION TESTING
   - Rephrase same question 5 different ways
   - Compare outputs for consistency
   - Note any semantic drift

4. RELIABILITY SCORING
   - Run same prompt 10 times
   - Document variation in responses
   - Flag prompts with >5% variation

5. HUMAN REVIEW
   - Does the answer make business sense?
   - Would a domain expert agree?
   - Is the confidence appropriate?

they reached clients.`

=====================

TESTING PHILOSOPHY:
"Trust but verify" isn't enough with AI.
It's "Verify, document, then cautiously trust."

DAILY QA CHECKLIST:
□ Run standard prompt battery (15 prompts)
□ Compare to previous day's baseline
□ Document any drift or variation
□ Flag anomalies for engineering review
□ Update reliability scores

WEEKLY QA TASKS:
□ Edge case testing round
□ New prompt validation
□ Client-reported issue investigation
□ Prompt library maintenance
□ Documentation updates

MONTHLY QA TASKS:
□ Full regression testing
□ Performance metric review
□ Prompt library audit
□ Training material updates
□ Stakeholder report

ISSUE CLASSIFICATION:
🔴 Critical: Wrong data, business impact
🟡 Major: Inconsistent results, confusion
🟢 Minor: Formatting, minor variations
⚪ Enhancement: Suggestions for improvement

==========================

WHAT IS HERMENEUTICS?
The art and science of interpretation. How people
make meaning from texts, conversations, experiences.

WHY IT MATTERS FOR AI:

1. UNDERSTANDING LLM INTERPRETATION
   - LLMs interpret prompts based on training context
   - Ambiguity leads to unpredictable results
   - Clear context = better interpretation
   (Same principles as human communication!)

2. DESIGNING FOR HUMAN INTERPRETATION
   - Users interpret AI responses through their lens
   - Domain expertise affects understanding
   - Cognitive load impacts comprehension

3. BRIDGING THE GAP
   - Technical output → Business meaning
   - Data → Decision-relevant insight
   - Complexity → Actionable clarity

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:

PROMPT DESIGN:
"How will the model interpret this?"
"What context is missing?"
"Where might ambiguity cause problems?"

TRAINING DESIGN:
"How will users process this information?"
"What prior knowledge are they bringing?"
"Where might confusion arise?"

OUTPUT VALIDATION:
"Does this make sense to a human reader?"
"Is the confidence appropriate?"
"What's being assumed vs. stated?"
