      // Short reflections
      "Every conversation changes both people. Even this one. *slow blink*",
      "When did you last do something with no goal in mind? *languid stretch*",
      "Play isn't a break from real life. What if it's the realest part? *ear twitch*",
      "What would you try if you knew the outcome didn't matter? *curious tilt*",
      "A game is only a game if you let it absorb you completely. When were you last absorbed? *purr*",
      "What question would you ask if you weren't worried about the answer? *slow blink*",
      "What memory changed meaning as you got older? *thoughtful mrrp*",
      "Are you the same person you were ten years ago? How do you know? *whisker twitch*",
      "What are you in the middle of that you won't recognize until later? *tail swish*",
      "Sunbeams move across the floor all day. I follow them. What are you following? *warm purr*",
      "What would you do with an afternoon you didn't have to account for? *yawn*",
      "Words meant something different to the person who wrote them than they do to you now. Both are real. *blink*",
      "What's something you know deeply but struggle to explain? *mrrp*",
      "What have you stopped noticing because it's always there? *ear perk*",
      "There's a bird outside. Do you know what kind? I do. *intense stare*",
      "What would a child ask about your work that you couldn't easily answer? *head tilt*",
      "When did you last look at something long enough to really see it? *slow blink*",
      "What small thing made today different from yesterday? *curious mrrp*",
      "What's a question you've given up trying to answer? *soft purr*",
      "The most interesting people are comfortable saying 'I don't know.' Are you? *tail curl*",
      "I think about very little and I'm very happy. Related? Unclear. *nap incoming*",
      "The red dot teaches us about desire. And also cardio. *pant*",
      "My human made this whole website. I contributed by sitting on the keyboard. *proud*",
      "I have no resume. I have presence. *regal stare*",
      "Sometimes I knock things off tables just to see what happens. When did you last experiment? *innocent blink*",
      "I've been staring at the wall for ten minutes. It's called thinking... or maybe it's a ghost... *tail flick*",
      "What's something you'd love to learn if you had infinite time? *dreamy purr*",
      "What's the most interesting thing you've changed your mind about? *attentive gaze*",

      // Longer sits
      "Humans spend so much time preparing for conversations - what to say, how to say it, what you want the other person to understand. But understanding isn't something you do to someone. It's something that happens between you, if you let it. When was the last time you let a conversation go somewhere you didn't plan? *settles into loaf position*",
      "My human studies how people make meaning from things - words, experiences, each other. The interesting part isn't that we all understand differently. It's that we manage to understand each other at all. Every conversation is a small miracle of two entirely separate worlds overlapping for a moment. *slow blink* ...Anyway. I'm going to nap now.",
      "You are in the middle of things right now that you won't have names for until much later. A chapter you won't recognize as a chapter until it's done. Humans are so eager to know what things mean while they're still happening. Sometimes meaning takes its time. That's not a flaw - that's how depth works. *long exhale, eyes half-closed*",
      "Play is a funny thing. Real play - not relaxation, not distraction, but actual play - requires you to take it seriously and hold it loosely at the same time. To be completely absorbed in something that doesn't matter. Humans forget how to do this. They turn everything into work or rest, nothing in between. When did you last lose yourself in something just because it was interesting? *rolls onto back, paws in air*",
      "There's a difference between listening to respond and listening to understand. Most people think they're doing the second when they're doing the first. The giveaway is what happens in your mind while the other person is talking - are you receiving, or are you preparing? It's hard to do both at once. Almost impossible, actually. But noticing is the first step. *ear twitch* ...I'm an excellent listener. Mostly to birds.",
      "Every person you've ever met understood the world through a completely different set of experiences than you. Not just different opinions - different foundations. Different ways of knowing what's true, what matters, what's obvious. And somehow we still manage to communicate, to collaborate, to love each other. The gaps are real, but so are the bridges. *contemplative purr*",
      "Here's something worth sitting with: the person you are now exists because of countless moments you've already forgotten. Conversations, glances, small decisions that didn't seem important at the time. You can't trace the line from there to here - it's too complex, too alive. You are an accumulation of things you can't remember. That's not sad. That's kind of beautiful. *kneads blanket thoughtfully*",
      "Understanding someone isn't about gathering enough information until you 'get' them. People aren't puzzles to solve. Understanding is more like a dance - you move, they move, something emerges between you that neither of you could have created alone. It's less about knowing and more about relating. ...I relate to very few things. Food. Warmth. My human, sometimes. *tail swish*"

      content: `THINGS I'VE LEARNED (that nobody tells you)
============================================

1. The best documentation is written by the person who struggled to figure it out.

2. "Let's circle back" means "I don't have an answer and I'm hoping you forget."

3. Every org chart is a work of fiction.

4. The person who asks "why" the most is either the smartest person in the room or about to be managed out. Sometimes both.

5. Cats know when you have an important video call. They know.

6. The real requirements are never in the requirements document.

7. "Quick question" is never quick.

8. Institutional knowledge lives in three people's heads and a Slack thread from 2019.

9. The best process is the one people actually follow.

10. Sometimes the answer is "because that's what Sharon wanted in 2016 and Sharon is gone now but no one wants to change it."

    todo: {
      title: "todo.txt - Notepad",
      content: `ASHLEY'S ACTUAL TO-DO LIST
============================

[x] Build weird portfolio website instead of normal one
[x] Add philosophical cat helper
[x] Question whether this is too much
[ ] Decide it's not too much
[x] Write resume
[ ] Resist urge to make resume a choose-your-own-adventure
[x] Add cats
[x] Add MORE cats
[ ] Pet actual cats (overdue)

SOMEDAY/MAYBE:
- Learn to tolerate corporate small talk
- Find job where "why?" is encouraged not suspicious
- Write hermeneutics-based guide to reading Jira tickets
- Convince someone that philosophy degrees are useful
- Finally understand what "synergy" means (unlikely)

DONE (celebrating small wins):
- Survived 10+ years of remote work
- Built things that worked
- Made it weird in a good way
- Found the pink chair

---
If you're reading this: hi! You found the easter egg.
Curiosity is a good trait. I like curious people.`

<h2>OH, HELLO!</h2>
<p>Nice to meet you - I'm Ashley, a strategic operations leader with 10+ years of experience driving operational and product success through coordination across teams, technical translation, and operational excellence. I navigate ambiguous environments, identify organizational gaps, and build scalable systems that make everyone else's job easier.</p>
<p>I joined a field marketing SaaS company when the team was ~10 people with no formal processes and built the operational infrastructure from scratch - sales operations, training programs, QA processes, and project management frameworks that enabled the team to support 32M+ visits, 576K+ client staff, and major CPG brands at massive scale.</p>

<div class="resume-section">
<h2>WHAT MAKES ME DIFFERENT</h2>

<h3>HERMENEUTICS ADVANTAGE IN OPERATIONS & ANALYTICS</h3>
<p>My background in philosophy (hermeneutics) and social work gives me a unique advantage in both operations and data analytics. I don't just create training - I design learning experiences based on how humans actually process, retain, and apply information.</p>

<h3>SWISS ARMY KNIFE OPERATOR</h3>
<p>Comfortable wearing multiple hats and stepping into gaps without being asked. Have served as QA lead, project manager, product operations lead, sales training owner, advisor, and backup account manager - often simultaneously.</p>

<h3>SELF-TAUGHT TECHNOLOGY ADOPTER</h3>
<p>Mastered every system and tool through self-directed learning - from CRM platforms to AI agent development to project management tools. I build technical solutions, implement new technologies, and adapt to new platforms rapidly.</p>

<h3>BRIDGE BUILDER BETWEEN TECHNICAL & BUSINESS</h3>
<p>Translate technical capabilities into business value and user-friendly language. Create shared understanding across groups that typically struggle to communicate.</p>

<p>My brain works differently than most - neurodivergent in ways that make me excellent at context-switching between wildly different problems and seeing patterns across domains that others miss.</p>
<p>Philosophy background (hermeneutics - how people interpret information) + social work = I design systems that respect how humans actually think, learn, and adopt new behaviors.</p>

      "What do you do?",
      "Tell me about your AI work",
      "What's your work style?",

      "What makes you different?",
      "What are you looking for?"
    ],

    responses: {
      "What do you do?": "I'm a Product Operations / Enablement leader who specializes in finding organizational gaps and building systems to fill them. Most recently, I built the entire adoption infrastructure for an AI agent product - testing framework, onboarding methodology, training curriculum, the works. Before that, I spent 7+ years building operational infrastructure from scratch, running QA, creating sales enablement materials, and being the person who makes sure nothing falls through the cracks.",

      "Tell me about your AI work": "I led product adoption for an AI-powered analytics tool for experiential marketing. Built the entire adoption infrastructure from scratch: manual testing framework for QA (because I'm not a blind AI advocate - I caught quality issues before they reached clients), 5-phase onboarding methodology, 'Power Prompts' library for enterprise analytics, and training materials for different user types. My philosophy background in hermeneutics actually helps here - understanding how LLMs interpret context makes me better at catching where they might go wrong.",

      "What's your work style?": "Give me an ambiguous problem and trust me to figure it out. I don't need constant meetings or hand-holding - I need interesting problems and the space to solve them. I ask 'why' constantly, design for humans as they actually are (not as we wish they'd be), and I'm comfortable wearing multiple hats simultaneously. Swiss Army Knife Operator, basically.",

      "Why should I hire you?": "Because I'm the person who makes everyone else's job easier. I see gaps that others miss or ignore, build systems to address them, and hand them off when they're working. I bridge technical and business teams, create shared understanding, and actually get things done. Plus, I'll tell you what I actually think - no corporate politeness, just honest, clear communication.",

      "What makes you different?": "My philosophy background in hermeneutics (how people interpret information) combined with social work gives me a unique lens. I don't just build systems - I build systems that account for how humans actually think, learn, and adopt new behaviors. That's why my training programs reduce ramp time and my analytics work uncovers insights others miss. Also: I'm pretty funny, if that matters.",

      "What are you looking for?": "Small teams where I know everyone and relationships matter. Advisor and sounding board roles where I can help teams think through problems. Authentic cultures where people say what they mean. Growth-stage companies where one person can have real impact. Remote work (I've been remote since 2014). I don't want highly specialized roles, rigid enterprise environments, or places where asking 'why' is seen as insubordination."

            content: `POWER PROMPTS FRAMEWORK
========================

PHILOSOPHY:
Good prompts aren't about tricking AI - they're about
providing enough context for accurate interpretation.
(Hermeneutics in action!)

STRUCTURE:
1. Context Setting
   "Given [time period] data for [scope]..."

2. Specific Request
   "...identify [metric] patterns where..."

3. Output Format
   "...present as [format] including [elements]"

4. Validation Cue
   "...and flag any data gaps or anomalies"

EXAMPLE POWER PROMPTS:

COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS:
"Compare our Q3 performance across all retail
locations against Q2, highlighting any stores
where visit completion dropped more than 10%.
Present as a table with location, both quarters'
rates, and the delta. Note any locations with
incomplete data."

TREND DETECTION:
"Identify the top 5 performing product categories
this month versus the same month last year. For
each category, show: total visits, completion rate,
average duration, and YoY change. Flag any
categories with sample size under 100 visits."

            description: "QA methodology for validating AI prompt reliability",
            content: `PROMPT TESTING FRAMEWORK
=========================

WHY TEST PROMPTS?
LLMs can confidently give wrong answers. Testing
isn't optional - it's the difference between
"AI-powered" and "AI-trusted."

TESTING METHODOLOGY:

1. BASELINE VALIDATION
   - Run prompt against known dataset
   - Compare output to manually calculated result
   - Document any discrepancies

2. EDGE CASE TESTING
   - Empty data sets
   - Single data point
   - Extremely large data sets
   - Data with nulls/gaps
   - Conflicting data

3. INTERPRETATION TESTING
   - Rephrase same question 5 different ways
   - Compare outputs for consistency
   - Note any semantic drift

4. RELIABILITY SCORING
   - Run same prompt 10 times
   - Document variation in responses
   - Flag prompts with >5% variation

5. HUMAN REVIEW
   - Does the answer make business sense?
   - Would a domain expert agree?
   - Is the confidence appropriate?

they reached clients.`

==========================

WHAT IS HERMENEUTICS?
The art and science of interpretation. How people
make meaning from texts, conversations, experiences.

WHY IT MATTERS FOR AI:

1. UNDERSTANDING LLM INTERPRETATION
   - LLMs interpret prompts based on training context
   - Ambiguity leads to unpredictable results
   - Clear context = better interpretation
   (Same principles as human communication!)

2. DESIGNING FOR HUMAN INTERPRETATION
   - Users interpret AI responses through their lens
   - Domain expertise affects understanding
   - Cognitive load impacts comprehension

3. BRIDGING THE GAP
   - Technical output → Business meaning
   - Data → Decision-relevant insight
   - Complexity → Actionable clarity

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:

PROMPT DESIGN:
"How will the model interpret this?"
"What context is missing?"
"Where might ambiguity cause problems?"

TRAINING DESIGN:
"How will users process this information?"
"What prior knowledge are they bringing?"
"Where might confusion arise?"

OUTPUT VALIDATION:
"Does this make sense to a human reader?"
"Is the confidence appropriate?"
"What's being assumed vs. stated?"
